# Wisconsin-Roadkill

Welcome to my reports on Wisconsin Roadkill! 

[all_animals_crashes_2017_2021.csv](https://github.com/amthompson23/Wisconsin-Roadkill/blob/main/all_animals_crashes_2017_2021.csv) is the raw dataset I used for my analysis. I obtained it from the Wisconsin Department of Transportation. This dataset contains data from 2017-2021 and includes all crash reports that included an animal. Each entry contains information such as time and time of crash, species of animal (Deer, Opossum, Raccoon, Coyote, Turkey, Bear, and an "other non-domesticated" category), and location of crash with road and for most entries, the GPS coordinates.

[Report.md](https://github.com/amthompson23/Wisconsin-Roadkill/blob/main/Report.md) is the main report of my analysis. 

Figures contains the graphs and maps created using this data.

The Documentation Folder contains my code and .shp files used to create the maps. The .shp files were also obtained from the Wisconsin Department of Transportation.
