# Wisconsin-Roadkill

Welcome to my reports on Wisconsin Roadkill! 

[all_animals_crashes_2017_2021.csv](https://github.com/amthompson23/Wisconsin-Roadkill/blob/main/all_animals_crashes_2017_2021.csv) is the raw dataset I used for my analysis. I obtained it from the Wisconsin Department of Transportation. This dataset contains data from 2017-2021 and includes all crash reports that included an animal. Each entry contains information such as time and time of crash, species of animal (Deer, Opossum, Raccoon, Coyote, Turkey, Bear, and an "other non-domesticated" category), and location of crash with road and for most entries, the GPS coordinates.
